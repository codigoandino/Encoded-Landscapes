Inka Territory Mountain Peak Dataset and Peak Alignment Analysis

Overview

This repository is a comprehensive archive of all identified mountain peaks within the ancient Inka territory of the Andes Mountain Range. The dataset has been meticulously created using the our Peak Mapper software and encompasses various filtering levels, which we refer to as overlay_class. Additionally, this repository houses the mountain-peak alignment module (creaTablas), its binary code, and all the input data (Peak_Final_Mercapt) used for the peak alignment analysis detailed in the article "Encoded Landscapes: How Wall Patterns of Inka Settlements May Reflect Andean Geomorphology".

Dataset

The dataset created with Peak Mapper spans the entire Inka territory, segmented according to various filtering levels for comprehensive analysis. Each entry is cataloged with precise geospatial references and characteristics.

Mountain-Peak Alignment Module (creaTablas)

The creaTablas module is the core of our peak alignment tool. It facilitates the computational analysis of the parallel alignment of mountain peaks at different azimuths. The module and its binary code are available for further research and validation of our study.

Input Data (Peak_Final_Mercapt)

The Peak_Final_Mercapt contains all the input data utilized in our peak alignment analysis. This data set is essential for replicating the study results or for extending the research to new areas or hypotheses.
